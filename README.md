# Divvy-Bike-Share-Data-Analysis
This study explored the spatiotemporal riding trends in Chicago by analyzing large BSS data from January to December of 2019.
We evaluate socio-demographic features such as (1) the frequency and duration of weekday and weekend trips by members and (2) the temporal and spatial patterns of their trips using data on trips taken by subscribing and unsubscribed members of the Divvy Bike Share System.
## Introduction
The popularity of bike-sharing systems has been growing in recent years as a way to reduce traffic congestion, promote physical activity, and reduce pollution. However, given to the relatively recent introduction of bicycles, there has been little research into how users experience these systems in the context of current transit options.
Understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of bike-sharing systems can help optimize the placement of docking stations, predict demand, and improve the overall efficiency of the system. Moreover, it can be important for a variety of stakeholders, including bike-sharing operators, city planners, and policymakers.
## Methodology
After cleaning up the data and adding some parameters that were necessary for the analysis (i.e., age group, trip duration, etc.), the results in the following section were obtained. The number of unique bike IDs was 5996. The total number of trips generated in 2019 was 1,048,562. The vast majority of trips are very short. Therefore, we had to reduce the data to rides under or equal to 100 minutes. The new total number of trips was 935658 trips.
## Results
*PATTERNS RELATED TO USERS*
- There are far more subscribers than customers who ride in the Chicago Divvy network, about 85% to 15%.
- Regarding the pattern of use by gender, we found that the percentage of male riders (69%) is more important than female riders (21%).
- Both subscribers and customers in the age group of 20-30 are the largest groups of riders.
- Riders aged 20-29 made up 36% of overall ridership with people aged 30-39 coming in second with 29% of overall ridership.

*SPACIOTEMPORAL PATTERNS*
- Usage peaked at rush hours, around 8am and 5pm.
- The spike during the afternoon rush hour was sharper than in morning, which suggested that traffic concentration in the afternoon was more significant.
- Weekend BSS usage was much less than on weekdays.
- The station that had the highest trips generated was station #192 (Canal St & Adams St).
- The dominant route was one route that starts from station #76 (Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St).
- The most popular station by far is Streeter Dr. and Grand Ave., which is located on Navy Pier. It is a popular destination for both tourists and locals.
